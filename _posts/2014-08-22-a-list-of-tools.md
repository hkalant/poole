In the era of virtual education and online teaching, educators around the globe are in front of a really wide range of tools they can use in their courses. It is critical, yet too hard, to always stay up-to-date and be aware of all those resources.

Inspired by the [HN Tools of Trade, 2014 Edition](https://github.com/cjbarber/ToolsOfTheTrade), I decided to create a similar repository on GitHub with a list of tools and resources for every teacher out there.

If you are familiar with Github, [go to the repo](https://github.com/hkalant/EducationalToolsResources), star it, fork it and add your own tools of trade. It is available under the [CC0 license](http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)
