After 5 years of studying, I could not think of a better start than an internship.

My background is in Elementary Education. But since 2008 that I entered Higher Education to earn my Bachelor’s, I have never practically left. Apart from some internships and volunteer work I did in elementary schools, my interaction with academic institutions and projects was constant.

I always knew that I am interested in educational technology, but, during my Master’s year here in Bristol, I discovered my interests and that educational technology development is what I would like to do for a living. I am no software developer or anything, but educators are a vital part when it comes to technology in education. I want to get involved in the design and development.

Well, after 5 years of studying — yes, it took me that long to figure out what I want to do with my life — I could not think of a better start than an internship.

I work in the University of Bristol as an intern on the Technology-Enhanced Learning Team, lead by Hilary Griffiths. It is no more than 4 hours per day, but it is a huge opportunity for me.

## The projects
The top priority project I am working on is the ‘Digital Literacies in Higher Education’ project. During last week I have been looking into what other Higher Education institutions are doing in terms of digital literacy awareness and produced short papers for each one of them. I looked into London School of Economics, The Open University and the Oxford Brookes University.

Up next, I will be preparing strategies for students' induction to the university TEL systems. I will be exploring resources currently used centrally or within schools and examples in other institutions and finally identifying effective practice, which will lead me to the preparation of summary report and recommendations.

For the last project, I will be investigating the students' experience of TEL. As companies need user's feedback to improve their products, TEL needs students' feedback to improve experience and the tools available in the university. Two othe members are already working on that, so probably we will be collaborating with them to run some workshops and focus groups.

## The office
Really glad I have the chance to use my own laptop while working here in the TEL team. The workspaces are not really intuitive, the setup has major limitations (e.g. you cannot install any software) and I am surprised that the rest of the team can manage their workload with the university’s machines.
