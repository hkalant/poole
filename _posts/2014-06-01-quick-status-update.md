Hey.

This is a major redesign of my personal website, blog and internet home. Founded in March 2009, I blog ever since about education technology, e-learning and all things education.

The blog has been running on WordPress for 5 years, then it moved to Ghost and but now over to [Jekyll and GitHub Pages](/colophon).

I use this website for several purposes including:

To maintain my online identity.

A place to publish things I discover, my personal thoughts.

A venue for practice new things I learn.

You should follow me @hkalant.
